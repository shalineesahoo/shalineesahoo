Result-oriented Analyst with 2.6+ years of experience in transforming data into actionable insights that fuel growth, engagement, and retention. Skilled in App Store Optimization (ASO), data visualization, and business intelligence, I help products scale through data-driven strategies. Currently working as a **Client Analytics Specialist (Business Reporting Analyst)**, where I deliver insights, dashboards, and reporting solutions that drive measurable business outcomes and support stakeholder decision-making.

Over the past few years, I’ve:  
- Delivered **30% growth in organic downloads** and **15% boost in retention** for fintech apps through ASO and analytics.  
- Built **SQL-driven Power BI dashboards** that helped stakeholders track installs, churn, and user behavior trends.  
- Automated **Excel reporting workflows**, reducing manual effort by 40%.  
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams (product, marketing, sales) to align decisions with data insights.  

I’m passionate about **data storytelling, process automation, and problem-solving**, and I enjoy bridging the gap between **business goals and technical solutions**.
